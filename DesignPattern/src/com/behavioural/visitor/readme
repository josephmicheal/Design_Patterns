Problem
 
Imagine that your team develops an app which works with geographic information structured as one colossal graph. 
Each node of the graph may represent a complex entity such as a city, but also more granular things like industries, 
sightseeing areas, etc. The nodes are connected with others if there’s a road between the real objects that 
they represent. Under the hood, each node type is represented by its own class, while each specific node is an object.


At some point, you got a task to implement exporting the graph into XML format. 
At first, the job seemed pretty straightforward. You planned to add an export method to each node class and then leverage recursion to go over each node of the graph, executing the export method. The solution was simple and elegant: thanks to polymorphism, you weren’t coupling the code which called the export method to concrete classes of nodes.

Unfortunately, the system architect refused to allow you to alter existing node classes. 
He said that the code was already in production and he didn’t want to risk breaking it 
because of a potential bug in your changes.

The XML export method had to be added into all node classes, which bore the risk of breaking 
the whole application if any bugs slipped through along with the change.

Besides, he questioned whether it makes sense to have the XML export code within the node classes. 
The primary job of these classes was to work with geodata. The XML export behavior would look alien there.

There was another reason for the refusal. It was highly likely that after this feature was implemented, 
someone from the marketing department would ask you to provide the ability to export into a different format, 
or request some other weird stuff. This would force you to change those precious and fragile classes again.


Solution

The Visitor pattern suggests that you place the new behavior into a separate class called visitor, 
instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior 
is now passed to one of the visitor’s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data 
contained within the object.
