Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, 
library or framework.

Identification: Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, 
but delegates most of the work to other classes. 
Usually, facades manage the full life cycle of objects they use.
