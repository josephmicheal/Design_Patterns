Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. 
A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before 
or after the request gets through to the original object.


Why would you want to control access to an object? Here is an example: 
you have a massive object that consumes a vast amount of system resources. 
You need it from time to time, but not always.
