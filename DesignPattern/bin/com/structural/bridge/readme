Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes 
into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.


The Bridge pattern attempts to solve this problem by switching from inheritance to the object composition. 

Bridge, State, Strategy (and to some degree Adapter) have very similar structures. 
Indeed, all of these patterns are based on composition, which is delegating work to other objects. However, they all solve different problems.
